@property(readonly,strong,nullable) NSDate *lastUnlockDate; //!< Time at which the app lock was last unlocked. nil if app lock is (re-)locked.
@property(readonly,strong,nullable) NSDate *lastLockEventDate; //!< Time at which the last lock event was registered (f.ex. unlocking, entering or leaving the app/extension) - used to determine timeout if no valid process sessions were found

#pragma mark - Settings
@property(assign,nonatomic) BOOL enabled; //!< Indicates whether the AppLock is enabled.
@property(assign,nonatomic) NSTimeInterval lockTimeout; //!< Indicates the amount of time since [last lock event and last valid session being removed] after which an unlocked AppLock is re-locked

@property(readonly) NSUInteger maximumUnlockAttempts; //!< Indicates the total number of times an unlock can be attempted before time penalties kick in.

@property(assign,nonatomic) BOOL participateInLockTimeout; //!< Controls whether the current process takes part in determining the lock timeout. Defaults to YES. Should be NO for UI-less code running in the background (like File Extensions).
